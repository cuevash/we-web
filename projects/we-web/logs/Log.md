* Creating the templates on the monorepo of the weweb.
* Creating simple remix app to be connected to its plasmic counterpart to develop the weweb web site.
* It would be nice to create a simple plugin to create a template of a remix app for a nx workspace... work to do.
* Figuring out how to let the dependencies on the local package.json of the weweb-site not to be only included on the package.json of the workspace.
* As remix does not yet integrate well with nx, we are going to create individual remix app templates repos. When they play nicely with nx they will be intgrated into the we-web monorepo. The project info will be kept already on the weweb monorepo.

* I will try to learn plasmic reproducing the bejamas web page.
