* Creating a minimal single page example of a landing page with plasmic
* Steps:
  * Creating a new project in plasmic with minimalist template -> "Anna Wu"
  * npx create-plasmic-app 
    * using name "roche-infograpia-effects-cancer-diet"
    * Link to the previous project created in plasmic
    * This will sync both sides of the project. The design and the code.
  * Add project to github
  * Prepare project to generate next static build.
  * Add simple local font as template of to do it.
    * Added 'Pacifico' font and applied to some elements to check it is working
    * Added 'Pacifico' font to plasmic using localhost app host

* Creating an action to init, sync and deploy to dev from the plasmic side.

* Construction a simple workflow for landing pages and static web-sites.

* To implement something similar to what plasmic is doing to call an action I leave here this curl as reference
of what needs to be called from plasmic project.
